    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 overview The OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 is a data-collection component that transfers time-series data from source devices to OSIsoft OMF endpoints in OSIsoft Cloud Services or PI Servers. [...] The adapter is installed with a download kit obtained from the OSIsoft Customer Portal and works on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. All functions of the adapter are configured using REST API and configurations are stored in JSON files. For data ingress, an adapter component must be defined in System components configuration for each device to which the adapter will connect. Each adapter component is then configured with the connection information for the device and the data to collect. For data egress, configuration is needed to specify destinations for the data, including security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add buffering configuration to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting. Once the adapter is configured and sending data, use administration functions to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Use health and diagnostics functions to monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. The EdgeCmd utility is an OSIsoft proprietary command line tool that is used to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is installed separately from the adapter."

Configure logging Complete the following procedure to change the logging configuration: Using any text editor, create a file that contains the logging configuration in JSON form. For content structure, see Example . For all available parameters, see Logging parameters . Save the file, for example as Component_Logging.json . Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to execute a PUT command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/Logging . Note: Replace <ComponentId> with the ComponentId of the adapter, for example OpcUa1 . 5590 is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value. Example using curl (run this command from the same directory where the file is located): curl -d \"@Component_Logging.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/Logging\" On successful execution, the log level change takes effect immediately during runtime. The other configurations (log file size and file count) get updated after the adapter is restarted. Note: Any parameter not specified in the updated configuration file will revert to the default schema value. Logging schema The full schema definition for the logging configuration is in the component specific logging file: AdapterName_Logging_schema.json , OmfEgress_Logging_schema.json , or System_Logging_schema.json here: Windows: %ProgramFiles%\\OSIsoft\\Adapters\\AdapterName\\Schemas Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/AdapterName/Schemas Logging parameters The following parameters are available for configuring logging: Parameter Required Type Description logLevel Optional reference The logLevel sets the minimum severity for messages to be included in the logs. Messages with a severity below the level set are not included. The log levels in their increasing order of severity are as follows: Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical, None. For detailed information about the logLevels, see LogLevel . logFileSizeLimitBytes Optional integer The maximum size in bytes of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. logFileCountLimit Optional integer The maximum number of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. LogLevel Level Description Trace Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data like actual received values, which is why these messages shouldn’t be enabled in production environment. Debug Logs that can be used to troubleshoot data flow issues by recording metrics and detailed flow related information. Information Logs that track the general flow of the application. Any non-repetitive general information (like version information relating to the software at startup, what external services are being used, data source connection string, number of measurements, egress URL, change of state “Starting”, “Stopping”, or configuration) can be useful for diagnosing potential application errors. Warning Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but does not otherwise cause the application execution to stop. Warning messages can indicate an unconfigured data source state, that a communication with backup failover instance has been lost, an insecure communication channel in use, or any other event that could require attention, but that does not impact data flow. Error Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure. This can indicate an invalid configuration, unavailable external endpoint, internal flow error, and so on. Critical Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. This can indicate application wide failures like beta timeout expired, unable to start self-hosted endpoint, unable to access vital resource (for example, Data Protection key file), and so on. None Logging is disabled for the given component. Example Default logging configuration By default, logging captures Information, Warning, Error, and Critical messages in the message logs. The following logging configuration is the default for a component on install: { \"logLevel\": \"Information\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 34636833, \"logFileCountLimit\": 31 } REST URLs Relative URL HTTP verb Action api/v1/configuration/System/Logging GET Retrieves the system logging configuration api/v1/configuration/System/Logging PUT Updates the system logging configuration api/v1/configuration/ ComponentId /Logging GET Retrieves the logging configuration of the specified adapter component api/v1/configuration/ ComponentId /Logging PUT Updates the logging configuration of the specified adapter component Note: Replace ComponentId with the Id of your adapter component, for example Modbus1 or OpcUa1."

While the files are accessible to view, OSIsoft recommends that you use REST or EdgeCmd utility for any changes you make to the files. As part of making adapters as secure as possible, any passwords or secrets that you configure are stored in encrypted form (with cryptographic key material stored separately in a secure location.) If you edit the files directly, the adapter may not work as expected. Note: You can edit any single component or facet of the system using REST, but also configure the system as a whole with a single REST call. Configure system components The configuration of system components includes adding, updating and deleting components. Add a system component Complete the following procedure to add a new component to the system: Using any text editor, create a file that contains the component to be added to the system in JSON form. For content structure, see Examples . For a table of all available parameters, see System components parameters . Note: The OmfEgress component is required for this initial release for adapters to run. You can add additional components if you want, but only a single OmfEgress component is supported. The following example adds a Modbus TCP adapter. { \"ComponentId\": \"Modbus1\", \"ComponentType\": \"Modbus\" } Note: A unique ComponentId is necessary for each component in the system. This example uses the ComponentId Modbus1 since it is the first Modbus TCP adapter: Save the file, for example as AddComponent.json . Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to execute a POST command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/components Note: 5590 is the default port number.
