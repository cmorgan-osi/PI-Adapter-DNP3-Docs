    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 overview The OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 is a data-collection component that transfers time-series data from source devices to OSIsoft OMF endpoints in OSIsoft Cloud Services or PI Servers. [...] The adapter is installed with a download kit obtained from the OSIsoft Customer Portal and works on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. All functions of the adapter are configured using REST API. The configurations are stored in JSON files. For data ingress, an adapter component must be defined in the system components configuration for each device to which the adapter will connect. Each adapter component is then configured with the connection information for the device and the data to collect. For data egress, configuration is needed to specify destinations for the data, including security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add buffering configuration to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting purposes. Once the adapter is configured and sending data, administration functions are used to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Health and diagnostics functions monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. The EdgeCmd utility is an OSIsoft proprietary command line tool that is used to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is installed separately from the adapter. <!-- # OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 ======= - [OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 overview](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForDNP3Overview) - [OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 principles of operation](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForDNP3PrinciplesOfOperation) - [OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 supported features](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForDNP3SupportedFeatures) - [Installation](xref:Installation) - [Install the adapter](xref:InstallTheAdapter) - [Install OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 using Docker](xref:InstallOSIsoftAdapterForDNP3UsingDocker) - [Uninstall the adapter](xref:UninstallTheAdapter) - [Configuration](xref:ModbusConfiguration) - [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools) - [System components configuration](xref:SystemComponentsConfiguration) - [OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 data source configuration](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForDNP3DataSourceConfiguration) - [OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 data selection configuration](xref:OSIsoftAdapterForDNP3DataSelectionConfiguration) - [Egress endpoints configuration](xref:EgressEndpointsConfiguration) - [Health endpoint configuration](xref:HealthEndpointConfiguration) - [Diagnostics configuration](xref:DiagnosticsConfiguration) - [Buffering configuration](xref:BufferingConfiguration) - [Logging configuration](xref:LoggingConfiguration) - [System and adapter configuration](xref:SystemAndAdapterConfiguration) - [Administration](xref:Administration) - [Start and stop an adapter](xref:StartAndStopAnAdapter) - [Start and stop ingress component](xref:StartAndStopIngressComponent) - [Retrieve product version information](xref:RetrieveProductVersionInformation) - [Delete an adapter component](xref:DeleteAnAdapterComponent) - [Health and diagnostics](xref:HealthAndDiagnostics) - [Adapter health](xref:AdapterHealth) - [Device status](xref:DeviceStatus) - [Next health message expected](xref:NextHealthMessageExpected) - [Adapter diagnostics](xref:AdapterDiagnostics) - [System](xref:System) - [Stream count](xref:StreamCount) - [IO rate](xref:IORate) - [Error rate](xref:ErrorRate) - [Egress diagnostics](xref:EgressDiagnostics) -->"

Note: If you want to use Docker, you must be familiar with the underlying technology and have determined that it is appropriate for your planned use of the DNP3 Adapter. Docker is not a requirement to use DNP3 Adapter. This topic provides examples of how to create a Docker container with the DNP3 Adapter. Create a startup script for the adapter Using any text editor, create a script similar to the following. Note: The script varies slightly by processor.

Create a Docker container containing the DNP3 Adapter Create the following Dockerfile in the directory where you want to create and run the container. Note: Dockerfile is the required name of the file. Use the variation according to your operating system: ARM32 FROM ubuntu WORKDIR / RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libicu60 libssl1.0.0 COPY dnp3dockerstart.sh / RUN chmod +x /dnp3dockerstart.sh ADD ./DNP3_linux-arm.tar.gz . ENTRYPOINT [\"/dnp3dockerstart.sh\"] ARM64 FROM ubuntu WORKDIR / RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libicu60 libssl1.0.0 COPY dnp3dockerstart.sh / RUN chmod +x /dnp3dockerstart.sh ADD ./DNP3_linux-arm64.tar.gz . ENTRYPOINT [\"/dnp3dockerstart.sh\"] AMD64 (x64) FROM ubuntu WORKDIR / RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libicu60 libssl1.0.0 COPY dnp3dockerstart.sh / RUN chmod +x /dnp3dockerstart.sh ADD ./DNP3_linux-x64.tar.gz . ENTRYPOINT [\"/dnp3dockerstart.sh\"] Copy the DNP3_linux-<platform>.tar.gz file to the same directory as the Dockerfile. Copy the dnp3dockerstart.sh script to the same directory. Run the following command line in the same directory (sudo may be necessary): docker build -t dnp3adapter . Run the DNP3 Adapter Docker container REST access from the local host to the Docker container Complete the following to run the container: Use the docker container dnp3adapter created previously. Type the following in the command line (sudo may be necessary): docker run -d --network host dnp3adapter Port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to DNP3 Adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, all data stored by the DNP3 Adapter is stored in the container itself. When the container is deleted, the data stored is also deleted. Provide persistent storage for the Docker container Complete the following to run the container: Use the docker container image dnp3adapter creasted previously. Type the following in the command line (sudo may be necessary): docker run -d --network host -v /dnp3:/usr/share/OSIsoft/ dnp3adapter Port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to DNP3 Adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, all data that would be written to the container is instead written to the host directory. In this example, the host directory is a directory on the local machine, /dnp3 . You can specify any directory. Port number change To use a different port other than 5590 you can specify a portnum variable on the docker run command line. For example, to start the adapter using port 6000 instead of 5590, you use the command line: docker run -d -e portnum=6000 --network host dnp3adapter Instead of accessing the REST API using port 5590 you use port 6000. The following curl command returns the configuration for the container. curl http://localhost:6000/api/v1/configuration Remove REST access to the Docker container If you remove the --network host option from the docker run command, no REST access is possible from outside the container. This may be of value where you want to host an application in the same container as DNP3 Adapter, and do not want to have external REST access enabled."

Messages with a severity below the level set are not included. The log levels in their increasing order of severity are as follows: Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical, None. For detailed information about the logLevels, see LogLevel . logFileSizeLimitBytes Optional integer The maximum size (in bytes) of log files that the service will create for the component.

LogLevel Level Description Trace Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data like actual received values, which is why these messages should not be enabled in production environment. Debug Logs that can be used to troubleshoot data flow issues by recording metrics and detailed flow related information. Information Logs that track the general flow of the application. Any non-repetitive general information like the following can be useful for diagnosing potential application errors: - Version information related to the software at startup - External services used - Data source connection string - Number of measurements - Egress URL - Change of state “Starting” or “Stopping” - Configuration Warning Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow that does not otherwise cause the application execution to stop. Warning messages can indicate an unconfigured data source state, that a communication with backup failover instance has been lost, an insecure communication channel in use, or any other event that could require attention, but that does not impact data flow. Error Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity and not an application-wide failure. It can indicate an invalid configuration, unavailable external endpoint, internal flow error, and so on. Critical Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. This can indicate application wide failures like beta timeout expired, unable to start self-hosted endpoint, unable to access vital resource (for example, Data Protection key file), and so on.

Available health data Dynamic data is sent every minute to configured health endpoints. The following health data are available: Device status Next Health Message Expected Health endpoint differences Two OMF endpoints are currently supported for adapter health data: PI Web API OSIsoft Cloud Services There are a few differences in how these two systems treat the associated health data. PI Web API parses the information and sends it to configured PI servers for the OMF endpoint. The static data is used to create a hierarchy on a PI AF server similar to the following: The dynamic health data is time-series data that is stored in PI points on a PI Data Archive. You can see it in the AF hierarchy as PI point data reference attributes. OSIsoft Cloud Services does not currently provide a way to store the static metadata. For OCS-based adapter health endpoints, only the dynamic data is stored. Each value is its own stream with the timestamp property as the single index."

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 overview The OSIsoft Adapter for DNP3 is a data-collection component that transfers time-series data from source devices to OSIsoft OMF endpoints in OSIsoft Cloud Services or PI Servers. [...] The adapter is installed with a download kit obtained from the OSIsoft Customer Portal and works on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. All functions of the adapter are configured using REST API. The configurations are stored in JSON files. For data ingress, an adapter component must be defined in the system components configuration for each device to which the adapter will connect. Each adapter component is then configured with the connection information for the device and the data to collect. For data egress, configuration is needed to specify destinations for the data, including security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add buffering configuration to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting purposes. Once the adapter is configured and sending data, administration functions are used to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Health and diagnostics functions monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. The EdgeCmd utility is an OSIsoft proprietary command line tool that is used to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is installed separately from the adapter."
