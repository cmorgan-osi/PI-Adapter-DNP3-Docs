You can use this information to ensure that your adapters are running properly and data is flowing to the configured OSIsoft OMF endpoints. This section provides information on how to configure your adapters so that this health data is produced and stored at a designated endpoint and what types of health data are available. Configure health endpoints A health endpoint designates an OSIsoft OMF endpoint where adapter health information should be sent. You can configure multiple health endpoints. Using any text editor, create a file that contains one or more health endpoints in JSON form. For a table of all available health endpoint parameters, see Parameters . Save the file. Use any tool capable of making HTTP requests and execute a POST command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: ` Parameters Parameter Required Type Description Id Optional string Uniquely identifies the endpoint. This can be any alphanumeric string. If left blank, a unique value is generated automatically. Endpoint Required string The URL of the OMF endpoint to receive this health data. ClientId Required for OCS endpoints string The Client Id used for authentication with an OSIsoft Cloud Services OMF endpoint. ClientSecret Required for OCS endpoints string The Client Secret used for authentication with an OSIsoft Cloud Services OMF endpoint. Username Required for PI Web API endpoints string The username used to authenticate with a PI Web API OMF endpoint. Password Required for PI Web API endpoints string The password used to authenticate with a PI Web API OMF endpoint. BufferingEnabled Optional bool Enables or disables buffering to this endpoint. By default, buffering is enabled (\"true\"). ValidateEndpointCertificate Optional bool Disables verification of destination security certificate. Use for testing only with self-signed certificates; OSIsoft recommends setting this to true in production environments. Defaults to true. Available health data Each individual adapter data component produces a few different pieces of health data. Dynamic data is sent every minute to configured health endpoints. The following health data are available: Device status Next Health Message Expected Health endpoint differences - PI Web API vs. OSIsoft Cloud Services Two following two OMF endpoints are currently supported for adapter health data: PI Web API OSIsoft Cloud Services There are a few differences in how these two systems treat the associated health data. PI Web API parses the information and sends it configured PI Systems for the OMF endpoint. The static data is used to create a hierarchy on a PI AF server similar to the following: The dynamic health data is actually time-series data that is stored in PI points on a PI Data Archive and can be seen in the AF hierarchy as PI Point Data Reference attributes. OSIsoft Cloud Services currently does not have a way to store the static metadata. For OCS-based adapter health endpoints, only the dynamic data will be stored. Each value will be its own stream with the timestamp property as the single index."

Egress is handled individually per configured endpoint. On first execution, types and containers will be egressed. After that only new or changed types or containers will be egressed. Type creation must be successful in order to create containers. Container creation must be successful in order to egress data. If an egress endpoint is removed, data flow will immediately end for that endpoint. Any buffered data for the endpoint that has been deleted will be permanently lost. Type, container, and data items are batched into one or more OMF messages when egressing. As per the requirements defined in OMF, a single message payload will not exceed 192KB in size. Compression is automatically applied to outbound egress messages. On the destination, failure to add a single item will result in the message failing. Types, containers, and data will continue to be egressed as long as the destination continues to respond to HTTP requests - retrying previous failures as needed."

The Egress component is required for this initial release for adapters to run. [ { \"ComponentId\": \"Egress\", \"ComponentType\": \"OmfEgress\" } ] You can add additional components if you want, but only a single OmfEgress component is supported. To add a new component, create a JSON file with the ComponentId and ComponentType. The following example adds a Modbus TCP adapter. Note: A unique ComponentId is necessary for each component in the system. This example uses the ComponentId Modbus1 since it is the first Modbus TCP adapter: { \"ComponentId\": \"Modbus1\", \"ComponentType\": \"Modbus\" } Save the JSON in a file named AddComponent.json . From the same directory where the file exists, run the following curl script: curl -i -d \"@AddComponent.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:5595/api/v1/configuration/system/components After the curl command completes successfully, you can configure or use the new component. Delete a component To delete an existing component, run the following curl script: curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5595/api/v1/configuration/system/components/{ComponentId_To_Delete}/ All the logs and configurations files for the deleted components will be moved to the corresponding logs/Removed or Configuration/Removed folder. System components schema The following table defines the basic behavior of the AddComponent.json file. Abstract Extensible Status Identifiable Custom properties Additional properties Can be instantiated Yes Experimental No Forbidden Forbidden Parameters for system components The following parameters are available for configuring system components. Parameters Required Type Nullable Description ComponentId Required string Yes The ID of the component. It can be any alphanumeric string, for example Egress. ComponentType Required string Yes The type of the component, for example OmfEgress. There are two types of components: OmfEgress and the adapter. System components example [ { \"componentId\": \"Modbus1\", \"componentType\": \"Modbus\" }, { \"componentId\": \"Modbus2\", \"componentType\": \"Modbus\" }, { \"ComponentId\": \"Egress\", \"ComponentType\": \"OmfEgress\" } ]"

    "keywords": "Delete an adapter component An adapter instance can be removed by making a DELETE call with either a REST client or the EdgeCmd utility. When an adapter instance is removed, the configuration and log files are saved into a sub-directory in case they are needed later. Any associated types, streams, and data will remain on respective endpoints. File Relocation All configuration and log files will be renamed and moved to a folder called \"Removed\" within the respective directory. Configuration files will be moved to .\\Configuration\\Removed; logs files to .\\Logs\\Removed. The files are renamed according to the timestamp of removal, e.g. FileName.json_removed_yyyy-MM-dd--hh-mm-ss. In the following example, one Modbus Adapter service is installed on a particular Windows node with the name \"ModbusService1\". A Modbus component with the name \"ModbusDeviceX\" was added and configured to this Modbus adapter and later removed. Similar behavior will be seen on Linux. This is the resulting relocation and renaming scheme after deletion: REST Command: DELETE An empty DELETE command must be made against the Id of the component to be deleted. Using cURL: curl -v -X DELETE \"http://localhost:5595/api/v1/configuration/system/components/ComponentIdToBeDeleted\" REST URLs Relative URL HTTP verb Action api/v1/configuration/system/components/{id} DELETE Deletes specified component"
