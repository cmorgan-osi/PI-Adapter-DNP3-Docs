    "keywords": "System components configuration OSIsoft adapters use JSON configuration files in a protected directory on Windows and Linux to store configuration that is read on startup. While the files are accessible to view, OSIsoft recommends that you use REST or the edgecmd command line tool for any changes you make to the files. As part of making adapters as secure as possible, any passwords or secrets that you configure are stored in encrypted form (with cryptographic key material stored separately in a secure location.) If you edit the files directly, the adapter may not work as expected. Note: You can edit any single component or facet of the system using REST, but also configure the system as a whole with a single REST call. Configure system components The default System_Components.json file for the System component contains the following information. The Egress component is required for this initial release for adapters to run. [ { \"ComponentId\": \"Egress\", \"ComponentType\": \"OmfEgress\" } ] You can add additional components if you want, but only a single OmfEgress component is supported. To add a new component, create a JSON file with the ComponentId and ComponentType. The following example adds a Modbus TCP adapter. Note: A unique ComponentId is necessary for each component in the system. This example uses the ComponentId Modbus1 since it is the first Modbus TCP adapter: { \"ComponentId\": \"Modbus1\", \"ComponentType\": \"Modbus\" } Save the JSON in a file named AddComponent.json . From the same directory where the file exists, run the following curl script: curl -i -d \"@AddComponent.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" http://localhost:5595/api/v1/configuration/system/components After the curl command completes successfully, you can configure or use the new component. Delete a component To delete an existing component, run the following curl script: curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5595/api/v1/configuration/system/components/{ComponentId_To_Delete}/ All the logs and configurations files for the deleted components will be moved to the corresponding logs/Removed or Configuration/Removed folder.

    "title": "Message logging configuration",
    "keywords": "Message logging configuration Edge Data Store writes daily log messages to flat text files in the following locations: • Windows: %ProgramData%/OSIsoft/EdgeDataStore/Logs • Linux: /usr/share/OSIsoft/EdgeDataStore/Logs Each message in the log displays the message severity level, timestamp, and the message itself. Default logging configuration and schema By default, logging captures Information, Warning, Error, and Critical messages in the message logs. The following logging configuration is the default for a component on install: { \"logLevel\": \"Information\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 34636833, \"logFileCountLimit\": 31 } The schema file specifies how to formally describe the configuration parameters for message logging. It is located in: • Windows: %ProgramFiles%/OSIsoft/EdgeDataStore/Schema • Linux: /opt/EdgeDataStore/Schema Log levels The logLevel sets the minimum severity for messages to be included in the logs. Messages with a severity below the level set are not included. The log levels in their increasing order of severity are as follows: Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical. Table: General guidelines for setting the log level. Level Description Trace Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data like actual received values, which is why these messages shouldn’t be enabled in production environment. Debug Logs that can be used to troubleshoot data flow issues by recording metrics and detailed flow related information. Information Logs that track the general flow of the application. Any non-repetitive general information (like version information relating to the software at startup, what external services are being used, data source connection string, number of measurements, egress URL, change of state “Starting”, “Stopping”, or configuration) can be useful for diagnosing potential application errors. Warning Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but does not otherwise cause the application execution to stop. Warning messages can indicate an unconfigured data source state, that a communication with backup failover instance has been lost, an insecure communication channel in use, or any other event that could require attention, but that does not impact data flow. Error Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure. This can indicate an invalid configuration, unavailable external endpoint, internal flow error, and so on. Critical Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. This can indicate application wide failures like beta timeout expired, unable to start self-hosted endpoint, unable to access vital resource (for example, Data Protection key file), and so on. Log file count limit The logFileCountLimit controls the number of days the log files are stored before they are deleted. Change logging configuration To change the logging configuration complete the following steps: Update the parameters of the message logging configuration JSON file that you want as needed. For example, the Component_Logging.json file: { \"logLevel\": \"Warning\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 16777216, \"logFileCountLimit\": 30 } Save the file. Use any tool capable of making HTTP requests to execute a PUT command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/Logging . Example using curl (run this command from the same directory where the file is located): curl -i -d \"@Component_Logging.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X PUT http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/Logging Note: Replace <ComponentId> with the ComponentId of the adapter or Storage, for example OpcUa1 . On successful execution, the log level change takes effect immediately during runtime. The other configurations (log file size and file count) get updated after Edge Data Store is restarted. Note: Any parameter not specified in the updated configuration file will revert to the default schema value."

    "keywords": "Configure EdgeCmd utility The following sections provide instructions for the configuration of EdgeCmd utility for Windows or Linux. Note: The following EdgeCmd utility locations are based on the installation instructions in EdgeCmd utility . Location on Windows: C:\\Program Files\\OSIsoft\\EdgeCmd\\edgecmd.exe Note: Specify the full path when you use EdgeCmd on Windows. Location on Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/EdgeCmd/edgecmd Note: You can access EdgeCmd without using the full path on Linux. Edge Data Store configuration with EdgeCmd Most configuration options that can be done using REST can also be done using the edgecmd utility and command line arguments. Configuration and administrative REST interfaces are generally exposed through the command line. Read/write capabilities to the EDS storage component, OMF ingresss and SDS read/write capabilities are only available using the REST API. Get help The Edgecmd application provides a 'Help' utility. For general instructions on how to use the Edgecmd application, type: edgecmd Help You can also use the utility to get help for any registered component in Edge Data Store. If you add a specific component ID to the end of the previous command, you receive help output for every configuration facet that the component supports, along with examples of commands that you can run to configure the component. Example: View help for the 'System' component: edgecmd Help System --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component System command-line options => 'Logging' --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LogLevel [Required] Desired log level settings. Options: Verbose, Information, Warning, Error, Fatal. LogFileSizeLimitBytes [Required] Maximum size in bytes of log files that the service will create for this component. Must be no less than 1000. LogFileCountLimit [Required] Maximum number of log files that the service will create for this component. Must be a positive integer. Example: ./edgecmd Configuration System Logging LogLevel=Warning Example: ./edgecmd Configuration System Logging LogFileSizeLimitBytes=32768 Example: ./edgecmd Configuration System Logging LogFileCountLimit=5 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component System command-line options => 'HealthEndpoints' --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Id [Optional] Id of existing configuration to be edited of removed. Endpoint [Required] URL of OMF destination UserName [Required group 1] User name used for authentication to PI Web API OMF endpoint. Password [Required group 1] Password used for authentication to PI Web API OMF endpoint. ClientId [Required group 2] Client ID used for authentication to OSIsoft Cloud Services. ClientSecret [Required group 2] Client Secret used for authentication to OSIsoft Cloud Services. Buffering [Optional] Set the buffering type for messages to this endpoint. Options are 'memory', 'disk' or 'none'. Defaults to 'none'. MaxBufferSizeMB [Optional] If an integer >0, this is the limit on the maximum megabytes of data to buffer for messages to this endpoint. Useful for limiting memory or disk usage growth in the event of disconnection to the endpoint. If the buffer is full, old messages will be discarded for new messages. Defaults to 0. ValidateEndpointCertificate [Optional] If true, endpoint certificate will be validated (recommended). If false, any endpoint certificate will be accepted. OSIsoft strongly recommends using disabled endpoint certificate validation for testing purposes only. Note: Only one Required group must be specified. Group 1 for PI Web API or Group 2 for OCS. Example: ./edgecmd Configuration System HealthEndpoints Endpoint=endpointURL UserName=UserName Password=Password --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component System command-line options => 'Port' --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Port [Required] The tcp port to bind this application host to (Range [1024,65535]) Example: ./edgecmd Configuration System Port Port=5590 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component System command-line options => 'Components' --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ComponentId [Required] ID of the hosted component. ComponentType [Required] Type of the hosted component. Example: ./edgecmd Configuration System Components ComponentId=Modus1 ComponentType=Modbus For help regarding a specific facet within a component, add the facet name after the component ID. Example: Help for the 'Port' facet within the 'System' component: edgecmd Help System Port --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component System command-line options => 'Port' --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Port [Required] The tcp port to bind this application host to (Range [1024,65535]) Example: ./edgecmd Configuration System Port Port=5590 Edge Data Store components The EdgeCmd utility enables you to add, configure, and delete Edge Data Store components. Add components With the following command, you can view which components are currently configured on Edge Data Store: edgecmd Configuration System Components To register a new component, use the following command: edgecmd Configuration System Components componentId=<componentId> componentType=<componentType> Valid component types are \"Modbus\" and \"OpcUa\". If you are trying to register a Modbus EDS adapter, use \"Modbus\" and if you are trying to register an OPC UA adapter, use \"OpcUa\". Example: Modbus adapter component registration: edgecmd Configuration System Components componentId=Modbus1 componentType=Modbus Configure components The EDS Modbus adapter and OPC UA adapter each have three configurable facets: data source, data selection, and logging. You can configure these with edgecmd by specifying a component ID and facet name. Example: Configuration of the data source facet of a Modbus adapter: edgecmd Configuration Modbus1 DataSource IpAddress=117.23.45.110 port=502 ConnectTimeout=15000 StreamIdPrefix=\"DataSource1\" For detailed information on how to configure each adapter, see the Modbus and OPC UA schemas. Delete components You can delete components from the Edge Data Store by using the following command: edgecmd Configuration System Components id=<componentId> delete Note: You can't delete the \"Storage\" component because it is required for Edge Data Store to operate. Retrieve existing system configuration You can use the edgecmd utility to view the configuration for each part of Edge Data Store. To view the entire configuration for every system component, run the following command: edgecmd Configuration To retrieve component specific configuration: edgecmd Configuration componentId To retrieve facet specific configuration of an Edge Data Store component: edgecmd Configuration componentId facetName For facets that contain multiple entries, you can retrieve the configuration for a specific entry by its Id: edgecmd Configuration componentId facetName id=IndexToRetrieve Examples View the configuration of Edge Data Store using edgecmd: edgecmd Configuration System { \"Logging\": { \"logLevel\": \"Information\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 34636833, \"logFileCountLimit\": 31 }, \"HealthEndpoints\": [], \"Port\": { \"port\": 5590 }, \"Components\": [ { \"componentId\": \"OpcUa1\", \"componentType\": \"OpcUa\" }, { \"componentId\": \"Modbus1\", \"componentType\": \"Modbus\" }, { \"componentId\": \"Storage\", \"componentType\": \"EDS.Component\" } ] } View the configuration of the 'System' component edgecmd Configuration System { \"Logging\": { \"logLevel\": \"Information\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 34636833, \"logFileCountLimit\": 31 }, \"HealthEndpoints\": [], \"Port\": { \"port\": 5590 }, \"Components\": [ { \"componentId\": \"Storage\", \"componentType\": \"EDS.Component\" } ] } View the configuration for the 'Logging' facet within the 'Storage' component edgecmd Configuration Storage Logging { \"logLevel\": \"Information\", \"logFileSizeLimitBytes\": 34636833, \"logFileCountLimit\": 31 } View the configuration of a specific entry in the 'PeriodicEgressEndpoint' facet within the 'Storage' component edgecmd Configuration Storage PeriodicEgressEndpoints id=Endpoint_1 { \"id\": \"Endpoint_1\", \"executionPeriod\": \"2.00:00:00\", \"name\": null, \"description\": null, \"enabled\": true, \"endpoint\": \"http://localhost:5590\", \"clientId\": null, \"clientSecret\": null, \"userName\": \"user_54\", \"password\": \"***************\", \"validateEndpointCertificate\": true, \"tokenEndpoint\": null, \"debugExpiration\": null, \"namespaceId\": \"default\", \"backfill\": false, \"egressFilter\": null, \"streamPrefix\": null, \"typePrefix\": null } Configure Edge Data Store To create a configuration, you must enter the component and facet where the configuration payload should go, followed by key=value pairs to specify which values are to be changed. Example: Change all values in the 'Logging' facet: edgecmd Configuration Storage Logging LogLevel=Warning LogFileSizeLimitBytes=32768 LogFileCountLimit=5 You can use this to configure any number of valid key=value pairs in a facet. Example: Change a single value in the 'Logging' facet: edgecmd Configuration Storage Logging LogFileCountLimit=5 You can also use it to add an entry to a collection configuration, for example, the 'Health Endpoints' facet in the 'System' component: edgecmd Configuration System HealthEndpoints Id=endpoint_1 Endpoint=endpointURL UserName=UserName Password=Password Note: If an entry with the specified id already exists, it will be updated based on the new key=value pairs. Configure with JSON Files You can also configure Edge Data Store by a JSON file input into the edgecmd application. File imports will completely replace the existing configurations that you are attempting to change. Therefore, it cannot be used to change individual values in a facet without modifying others. To import a bulk configuration: edgecmd Configuration file=PathToJsonFile To import a facet specific configuration file for a component: edgecmd Configuration componentId facetName file=PathToJsonFile To import a file with configuration for individual facets, you can use a bulk file import operation. The file must contain just payload for the given component ID. Example command: edgecmd Configuration file=\"~/Bulk_Storage_Runtime.json\" The file 'Bulk_Storage_Runtime.json' contains: { \"Storage\": { \"Runtime\": { \"StreamStorageLimitMb\": 66, \"StreamStorageTargetMb\": 33, \"IngressDebugExpiration\": \"2020-07-08T01:00:00\", \"CheckpointRateInSec\": 6, \"TransactionLogLimitMB\": 350, \"EnableTransactionLog\": true } } } The command will only affect the 'Runtime' facet in the 'Storage' component, it will not change any other components or facets. However, if you import a file containing the following, the 'StreamStorageLimitMb' and 'StreamStorageTargetMb' values would be modified, resetting the remaining values in the facet (IngressDebugExpiration, CheckpointRateInSec, TransactionLogLimitMB, and EnableTransactionLog) to their default values: { \"Storage\": { \"Runtime\": { \"StreamStorageLimitMb\": 66, \"StreamStorageTargetMb\": 33, } } } Delete configuration data You can use the edgecmd application to delete configuration data from Edge Data Store. To delete a configuration entry from a collection configuration (for example, 'HealthEndpoints' facet within the 'System' component), you must specify the component ID, facet, and ID of the entry to remove followed by the 'delete' keyword. Example: edgecmd Configuration System HealthEndpoints Id=endpoint_1 delete To delete an entire configuration file, you must specify the component ID and facet followed by the 'delete' keyword. Example: edgecmd Configuration System HealthEndpoints delete"

A new value for NextHealthMessageExpected will be sent by an individual adapter data component on a periodic basis while it is functioning properly. This value will be a timestamp indicating when the next value should be received. When monitoring, if the next value is not received by the indicated time, this likely means that there is an issue. It could be an issue with the adapter, adapter component, network connection between the health endpoint and the adapter, etc. Property Type Description Time string Timestamp of the event.

This section provides information on how to configure your adapters so that this health data is produced and stored at a designated endpoint and what types of health data are available. Configure health endpoints A health endpoint designates an OSIsoft OMF endpoint where adapter health information should be sent. You can configure multiple health endpoints. Using any text editor, create a file that contains one or more health endpoints in JSON form. For a table of all available health endpoint parameters, see Parameters . Save the file. Use any tool capable of making HTTP requests and execute a POST command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: ` Parameters Parameter Required Type Description Id Optional string Uniquely identifies the endpoint. This can be any alphanumeric string. If left blank, a unique value is generated automatically. Endpoint Required string The URL of the OMF endpoint to receive this health data. ClientId Required for OCS endpoints string The Client Id used for authentication with an OSIsoft Cloud Services OMF endpoint. ClientSecret Required for OCS endpoints string The Client Secret used for authentication with an OSIsoft Cloud Services OMF endpoint. Username Required for PI Web API endpoints string The username used to authenticate with a PI Web API OMF endpoint. Password Required for PI Web API endpoints string The password used to authenticate with a PI Web API OMF endpoint. BufferingEnabled Optional bool Enables or disables buffering to this endpoint. By default, buffering is enabled (\"true\"). ValidateEndpointCertificate Optional bool Disables verification of destination security certificate. Use for testing only with self-signed certificates; OSIsoft recommends setting this to true in production environments. Defaults to true. Available health data Each individual adapter data component produces a few different pieces of health data. Dynamic data is sent every minute to configured health endpoints. The following health data are available: Device status Next Health Message Expected Health endpoint differences - PI Web API vs. OSIsoft Cloud Services Two following two OMF endpoints are currently supported for adapter health data: PI Web API OSIsoft Cloud Services There are a few differences in how these two systems treat the associated health data. PI Web API parses the information and sends it configured PI Systems for the OMF endpoint. The static data is used to create a hierarchy on a PI AF server similar to the following: The dynamic health data is actually time-series data that is stored in PI points on a PI Data Archive and can be seen in the AF hierarchy as PI Point Data Reference attributes. OSIsoft Cloud Services currently does not have a way to store the static metadata. For OCS-based adapter health endpoints, only the dynamic data will be stored. Each value will be its own stream with the timestamp property as the single index."

Egress is handled individually per configured endpoint. On first execution, types and containers will be egressed. After that only new or changed types or containers will be egressed. Type creation must be successful in order to create containers. Container creation must be successful in order to egress data. If an egress endpoint is removed, data flow will immediately end for that endpoint. Any buffered data for the endpoint that has been deleted will be permanently lost. Type, container, and data items are batched into one or more OMF messages when egressing. As per the requirements defined in OMF, a single message payload will not exceed 192KB in size. Compression is automatically applied to outbound egress messages. On the destination, failure to add a single item will result in the message failing. Types, containers, and data will continue to be egressed as long as the destination continues to respond to HTTP requests - retrying previous failures as needed."
